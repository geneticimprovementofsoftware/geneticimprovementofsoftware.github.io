</figure>

Prof. Shin Yoo gained his PhD under Mark Harman in the CREST group at King's College, London and was a lecture in UCL's Centre for Research on Evolution, Search and Testing before returning to his native Korea to join in the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2015.
Shin has been active in software engineering research, particularly efficient mutation testing, code slicing, and fault localisation, for more than fifteen years.
He is an expert in mining fixes and GI and recently has shown large language models (LLMs) may be used in advanced software testing.
Dr. Yoo is and associate editor of ACM TOSEM and editorial board member of Empirical Software Engineering and Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines.
He has served on many conferences, including co-chair of ICST 2018, GI 2020, SSBSE 2022 and this year is the ICSE 2024 area-chair for testing and analysis.

## <a name="CFP"></a> Call For Submissions [[pdf]({{ "/paper_pdfs/gi2024icse/call_for_papers.pdf" | relative_url }})]

We invite submissions that discuss recent developments in all areas of research on, and applications of, Genetic Improvement.
The International Workshop on Genetic Improvement is the premier workshop in the field and provides an opportunity for researchers interested in automated program repair and software optimisation to disseminate their work, exchange ideas, and discover new research directions.
Topics of interest include both the theory and practice of Genetic Improvement. Applications of GI include, but are not limited to:
- Improve runtime efficiency
- Decrease memory consumption
- Decrease energy consumption
- Transplant new functionality
- Specialise software
- Generate multiple versions of software
- Improve low level or binary code
- Use of AI/large language models with GI
- Repair bugs
- GI techniques in industrial settings

We invite submissions of two paper types:
- Research papers (eight page limit, including references)
- Position papers (two page limit, including references)

The **<i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> best paper**, **<i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> best presentation** and **<i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> best reviewer** will be awarded during the workshop.

Detailed formatting instructions for authors are listed [here](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2024/icse-2024-research-track#submission-process).  
We encourage authors to submit early and in-progress work.
The workshop emphasises interaction and discussion.

Papers must be submitted through the paper submission website: [https://gi-at-icse2024-workshop.hotcrp.com/](https://gi-at-icse2024-workshop.hotcrp.com/)  
These papers will be reviewed in a double-blind manner.  
All accepted papers must be presented at the workshop.


### Special Issue on GI in the ASE journal

Authors of selected accepted papers are invited to submit an extended version of their papers to [ASE Journal's second Special Issue on Genetic Improvement](https://geneticimprovementofsoftware.com/events/ase2024).
